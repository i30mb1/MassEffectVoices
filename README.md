    * [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way
    * [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding) - library that allows you to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.
    * [Transition Animation](https://developer.android.com/training/transitions) - android's transition framework allows you to animate all kinds of motion in your UI by simply providing the starting layout and the ending layout.
    * [Paging](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/) - the Paging Library helps you load and display small chunks of data at a time. Loading partial data on demand reduces usage of network bandwidth and system resources.
* [Dynamic Delivery](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/dynamic-delivery) - dynamic delivery serves only those files to the users which they need and this is what allows us to make apps smaller
